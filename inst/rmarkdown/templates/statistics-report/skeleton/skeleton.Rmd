# Statistics Report Template

This template is designed to create a reproducible report, for use at Sheffield CTRU. It uses LaTeX to produce a pdf report and familiarity with LaTeX is essential for its use.

It is recommended that reading in the data, data wrangling and analyses take place in R scripts outside of this report and that this report is rendered using `rmarkdown::render()` rather than the knit button.
