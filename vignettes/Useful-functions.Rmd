The goal of Useful.functions is to streamline our R code, providing functions and templates for the repetitive tasks which are largely the same from trial to trial.\

The hope is that this package will improve efficiency and the reliability of our outputs. The contents of the package can be split into three sections:

- Functions
- Addins
- Templates
